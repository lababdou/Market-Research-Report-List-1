<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Warp Knitted Geogrid Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Biaxial Tension</li><li>Uniaxial Tension</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Warp knitted geogrids come in two main types: biaxial tension and uniaxial tension. Biaxial tension geogrids are designed to offer strength in both directions, providing reinforcement for soil stabilization and load distribution. On the other hand, uniaxial tension geogrids are engineered to withstand tension in one direction, typically used for applications such as retaining walls and embankments. Both types of geogrids play a crucial role in improving the overall performance and longevity of civil engineering projects.</p></p>
