<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Office Sound Masking Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Networked</li><li>Non-Networked</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Office sound masking systems are designed to create a more comfortable and private working environment by generating a low-level background noise that masks speech and other distractions. There are two main types of sound masking systems: networked and non-networked. Networked systems are integrated into the office's computer network, allowing for centralized control and management of the system. Non-networked systems, on the other hand, operate independently without the need for a computer network. Both types of systems aim to enhance office acoustics and improve employee productivity by reducing noise distractions.</p></p>
