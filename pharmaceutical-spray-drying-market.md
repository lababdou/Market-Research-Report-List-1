<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pharmaceutical Spray Drying Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressure Nozzles</li><li>Two-Fluid Nozzles</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The pharmaceutical spray drying market is categorized into two types of spray nozzles: pressure nozzles and two-fluid nozzles. Pressure nozzles use high-pressure pumps to create small droplets from the liquid pharmaceutical formulation, which are then dried using hot air in a spray dryer. On the other hand, two-fluid nozzles produce droplets by the collision of liquid and gas streams. Both types of spray nozzles play a crucial role in the pharmaceutical industry by enabling efficient and effective drug formulation through the spray drying process.</p></p>
