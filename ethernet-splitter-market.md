<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ethernet Splitter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive</li><li>Active</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Ethernet splitter market consists of two types: passive and active. Passive splitters simply divide the Ethernet signal into multiple parts without requiring any external power source. They are cost-effective but may result in weaker signal strength. On the other hand, active splitters use a built-in amplifier to boost and distribute the signal, ensuring better performance and signal quality. Although active splitters are more expensive, they are ideal for large networks where signal loss is a concern. In summary, passive splitters are budget-friendly while active splitters offer enhanced signal quality at a higher cost.</p></p>
