<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D Coordinate Measuring Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-contact Type</li><li>Contact Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The 3D Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMM) market consists of two primary types - non-contact type and contact type. The non-contact CMM relies on advanced technologies like laser or optical sensors to measure the dimensions and geometrical characteristics of objects without physical contact. This type allows for faster and more flexible measurements, suitable for delicate or soft objects. On the other hand, contact CMM uses mechanical probes to physically touch and collect data from the object, offering high accuracy but may be time-consuming. Both types serve diverse industrial applications and are chosen based on specific measurement requirements.</p></p>
