<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Conduction Implants Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Screw Implanted Device</li><li>Percutaneous Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bone conduction implants are medical devices that help individuals with hearing loss by bypassing the usual path of sound through the outer and middle ear and directly stimulating the inner ear. There are two types of bone conduction implants: screw implanted devices and percutaneous devices. Screw implanted devices are fixed to the skull bone through surgery, while percutaneous devices are connected to the skull through a small abutment but can be removed more easily. Both types of implants allow sound vibrations to bypass damaged parts of the ear and stimulate the inner ear directly for improved hearing.</p></p>
