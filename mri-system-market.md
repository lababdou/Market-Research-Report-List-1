<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MRI System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed MRI Systems</li><li>Open MRI Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The MRI system market can be divided into two types: Closed MRI Systems and Open MRI Systems. Closed MRI Systems are machines with tunnel-like structures where patients are placed for imaging. They offer high-quality images but can cause discomfort due to their confined space. Open MRI Systems, on the other hand, have a more open design which reduces the feeling of confinement, making it ideal for claustrophobic patients. Although Open MRI Systems generally produce lower-quality images, they provide a more comfortable experience for the patients.</p></p>
