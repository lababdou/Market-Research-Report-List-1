<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Triplex Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-action Design</li><li>Double-action Designs</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Triplex pumps are classified into two main types - single-action design and double-action design. Single-action design triplex pumps feature one piston, which operates in one direction, delivering fluid during one stroke. On the other hand, double-action design triplex pumps include two pistons operating in opposite directions, allowing for fluid delivery during both the forward and backward stroke. Both types have their advantages and applications in various industries, depending on factors such as pressure requirements and fluid viscosity.</p></p>
