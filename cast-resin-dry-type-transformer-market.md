<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cast Resin Dry Type Transformer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concentric Type</li><li>Overlap Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cast resin dry type transformers are used for electrical power distribution and have various types, including concentric type and overlap type. In concentric type transformers, the windings are arranged concentrically around the core, with the high voltage winding closer to the core and the low voltage winding outside it. This design allows for better heat dissipation and optimal electrical performance. On the other hand, overlap type transformers have windings arranged in a sandwich-like manner, where multiple layers of windings overlap each other, providing compact size and high efficiency. Both types cater to different requirements based on space constraints and efficiency needs.</p></p>
