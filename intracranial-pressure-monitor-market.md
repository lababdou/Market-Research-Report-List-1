<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intracranial Pressure Monitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The intracranial pressure monitor market consists of two main types: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive monitors are designed to be placed inside the brain to directly measure the pressure exerted by cerebrospinal fluid. They are more accurate but require surgical procedures for insertion. Non-invasive monitors, on the other hand, are placed outside the body and measure pressure indirectly through external parameters like blood flow or optic nerve sheath diameter. Although they are less accurate than invasive monitors, non-invasive options are less risky and easier to install, making them suitable for some patients.</p></p>
