<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Lithotripsy Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Use</li><li>Reusable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mechanical lithotripsy systems are medical devices used for the fragmentation of urinary or biliary stones. These systems can be classified into two types: single-use and reusable. Single-use systems are designed for one-time use and are disposed of after each procedure, ensuring sterility and reducing the risk of cross-contamination. On the other hand, reusable systems can be sterilized and used multiple times, providing cost-effectiveness. Both types offer the advantage of non-invasive stone fragmentation, allowing for safer and more efficient stone removal procedures.</p></p>
