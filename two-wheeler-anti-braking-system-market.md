<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Two-wheeler Anti-braking System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One-channel</li><li>Two-channel</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The two-wheeler anti-braking system market can be categorized into three types: one-channel, two-channel, and other markets. In a one-channel system, the anti-braking system controls only one wheel, typically the front wheel. This allows the rider to maintain better control during braking. On the other hand, a two-channel system regulates both wheels simultaneously, enhancing stability and control. The "Other" category refers to any emerging or unconventional systems that may not fit within these two categories but still offer anti-braking functionalities for two-wheelers. These different market types cater to varying consumer needs and preferences.</p></p>
