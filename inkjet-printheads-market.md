<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inkjet Printheads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piezoelectric Print Heads</li><li>Thermal Print Heads</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The inkjet printheads market can be categorized into three types: piezoelectric print heads, thermal print heads, and others. Piezoelectric print heads utilize an electric charge to deform a piezoelectric material, hence generating drops of ink. Thermal print heads, on the other hand, use thermal energy to create tiny bubbles that propel the ink onto the paper. The "others" category refers to emerging technologies and alternative methods that don't fit into the piezoelectric or thermal categories. These different types serve as the core components in inkjet printers for various printing applications.</p></p>
