<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wooden Base Anti-Static Floor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Resilient Anti-Static Flooring</li><li>Non-Resilient Anti-Static Flooring</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The wooden base anti-static floor market consists of two main types: resilient anti-static flooring and non-resilient anti-static flooring. Resilient anti-static flooring refers to floors that have a certain level of flexibility or "give" when pressure is applied, such as rubber or vinyl flooring. On the other hand, non-resilient anti-static flooring does not have any flexibility and remains rigid under pressure, such as epoxy or ceramic flooring. Both types of flooring are designed to minimize static electricity buildup and discharge, making them suitable for environments where electrostatic discharge control is crucial.</p></p>
