<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Marine Data Buoy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drifting Buoy</li><li>Moored Buoy</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Marine Data Buoy market encompasses different types of buoys used for collecting oceanic data. Drifting buoys are floating devices that move with ocean currents, equipped with sensors to measure various parameters like temperature and salinity. They provide valuable real-time data for weather forecasting and scientific research. On the other hand, moored buoys are anchored to the seafloor and can withstand harsh weather conditions. They offer more stable long-term observations, measuring variables like wave height, wind speed, and current velocities. Both buoy types play a crucial role in understanding and monitoring the marine environment.</p></p>
