<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flexible Shunt Compensation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Shunt Capacitive Compensation</li><li>Shunt Inductive Compensation</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Flexible shunt compensation refers to the use of capacitors or inductors to improve power system stability and voltage control. Shunt capacitive compensation involves the use of capacitors to inject leading reactive power into the system, which helps counteract the lagging reactive power of loads and improve voltage stability. Shunt inductive compensation, on the other hand, uses inductors to inject lagging reactive power, which is beneficial in systems with excessive leading reactive power. Both techniques are crucial in maintaining a balance between reactive power demand and supply, ensuring efficient and reliable power transmission.</p></p>
