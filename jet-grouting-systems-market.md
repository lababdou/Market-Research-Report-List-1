<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Jet-Grouting Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>The Single-Phase System</li><li>The Double-Phase System</li><li>The Three-Phase System</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The jet-grouting systems market encompasses three main types: the single-phase system, the double-phase system, and the three-phase system. The single-phase system involves injecting a binder solution into the soil while simultaneously eroding it with a high-pressure jet of fluid. The double-phase system employs a two-step process, first injecting a fluid to loosen the soil and then injecting a cement binder to strengthen it. The three-phase system incorporates an additional step where a high-pressure water jet is used to mechanically mix the soil, followed by injection of a cement binder for stabilization.</p></p>
