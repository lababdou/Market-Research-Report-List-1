<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Axial Ball Bearings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Direction Bearings</li><li>Double-Direction Bearings</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Axial ball bearings are categorized into two market types: single-direction bearings and double-direction bearings. Single-direction bearings are designed to accommodate axial loads in only one direction. These bearings can support thrust loads exerted in a specific direction. On the other hand, double-direction bearings are capable of supporting axial loads in both directions. This makes them suitable for applications where bi-directional thrust is present, such as in machinery with rotating components. Both types serve different purposes depending on the specific needs of the application.</p></p>
